## Getting Started

- Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azure-AppServices-Diagnostics-Portal.git`
- Either:
  - Install required dependencies locally by navigating to the angular root folder `AngularApp` and runing `npm install` (This will install all the required packages.) OR
  - Build and run a docker container that has all dependencies. Run AngularApp/buildimage.sh (or buildimage.bat on Windows) once to build an image locally and then AngularApp/startcontainer.sh (or startcontainer.bat on Windows) to build a container from that image and open a terminal on it.  Once the container is created, you can use the docker UI to stop/start and open a terminal to the container.

## App Service Diagnostics Portal

### Set Up a Local Development Environment

1. Create a Local Environment Settings file
   - Copy `AngularApp\projects\app-service-diagnostics\src\environments\environment.ts` to create `AngularApp\projects\app-service-diagnostics\src\environments\environment.local.ts`
   - Set key `"useApplensBackend"` to `true`
2. Get Resource Auth Token from ARM Client:
   - Install <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient">ArmClient</a>: `choco install armclient`
     - Ensure source `chocolatey` is enabled: `choco source enable -n=chocolatey`
   - Log in to ArmClient: `ARMClient.exe login`
   - Run `ARMClient.exe token {SubscriptionID}` with your Subscription ID, which will copy the Auth Token to the clipboard
3. Add Auth Token and ResourceID to Local Environment Settings:
   - Paste the ArmClient token from the above step into `authServiceToken` in `environment.local.ts`
   - Copy the ID of a Resource you want to test, and paste it into `authServiceResourceId` in `environment.local.ts`
4. Skip Authorization in ApplensBackend
   - Open `appsettings.Development.json`
   - Set `"ServerMode": "internal"`
5. Create a self-signed certificate for Applens
   - Navigate to `AngularApp\ssl`
   - Follow the instructions in `AngularApp\ssl\README.md` to create a self-signed certficate and install the certificate for your local machine in Trusted Root
6. Run the SSL server
   - Run `npm run ssl-local`
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` to confirm the server is up


### Testing Local Changes in the Azure Portal
  - Navigate to the Auzure portal with website extension specified as local: [Local Portal Test URL](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?websitesextension_ext=asd.env%3Dlocal)
   - This will load the "Diagnose and solve problems" iframe from `https://localhost:3000`. (Must be running in *ssl* mode).
   - Any changes made to the locally hosted project will be automatically refreshed in the Portal

### Testing Local Changes in the Portal

- In order to test your local changes in the portal, you can use the following links:
  - [Local](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?websitesextension_ext=asd.env%3Dlocal): This will load the iframe from `https://localhost:3000`. Must be running in *ssl* mode (`npm run ssl`).
  - [Staging](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?websitesextension_ext=asd.env%3Dstaging): This will load the iframe from `https://supportcenter-bay-staging.azurewebsites.net`

### Back End

- Right now the back end is optional as it is not required for functionality of the angular project.
- You will need appropriate secrets to be added to appsettings.Development.json.
- Open the `Backend` project in Visual Studio 2017 and run it in `IIS Express` mode.

### Production Build

- The production build commands for the angular projects are as follows:
  - `npm run build-applens` - Build Applens. Build output is placed in `ApplensBackend/wwwroot`.
  - `npm run build-asd` - Build App Service Diagnostic Portal. Build output is placed in `Backend/wwwroot`.
  - `npm run build` - Build both App Service Diagnostic Portal and Applens.
- If you have the appropriate Publishing Profiles, you can deploy these changes to the staging slots.
